Ogre Bullet demo
=============

Demo project that integrates the Ogre rendering engine with the Bullet Physics library.


Instructions
-------------

To compile the program, you need to have cmake installed.
Open the bash and compile it:

    $ cmake .
    $ make
    $ make install

Then, move to the bin directory (better open a new tab), and run it:

    $ cd dist/bin
    $ ./OgreApp

Alternatively, you can install and use Qt Creator (just open the CMakeList.txt file).
